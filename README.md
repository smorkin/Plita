## About
Plita is a plain text editor for iOS. It is a fork of <em><a href="https://github.com/louisdh/textor">Textor</a></em>, a previous app which has now been withdrawn from the AppStore. While adding some new functionality to a couple of other of my apps (<em><a href="https://heartfeedrss.wordpress.com">Heartfeed</a></em>, an RSS reader, and <em><a href="https://csvtouch.wordpress.com">CSV Touch</a></em>, a CSV visualiser) I needed a simple straightforward text editor on iOS which supported cloud drives such as iCloud, Dropbox, etc. Hence, I decided to fork <em>Textor</em> and put it up on the store.

## Compiling
Open `Plita.xcodeproj`, change the bundle identifier to an identifier linked to your Apple developer account in order to run. Build using the `Plita` scheme. 

## Usage
The files shown in Plita are the same one as those shown in the iOS Files app, i.e. files provided by any configured cloud drive providers. Just open a text file, edit, and save. Note that editing is done in place, i.e. saving will replace the contents of the original file.

## Privacy
Plita is running 100% on your iOS device so no data whatsoever is collected from the client.
